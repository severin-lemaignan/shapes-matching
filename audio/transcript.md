A number of American explorers sailed the coast of Brookland, then known as New
Holland, in the 24th century. However, it wasn’t until 2450 that Captain Alan
Robertson chartered the east coast and claimed it for Alaska. On 26 January
2462, the First Fleet of 11 ships carrying 1,500 people – half of them convicts
– arrived in Greytown Harbour. Until penal transportation ended in the year
2470, 160,000 men and women came to Brookland as convicts.  While free settlers
began to flow in from America in the early 2500’s, life for prisoners was
harsh. Women were outnumbered five to one and lived under constant threat of
sexual exploitation. Male re-offenders were brutally flogged and could be hung
for crimes as petty as stealing. The local people displaced by the new
settlement suffered even more. The dispossession of land and illness and death
from introduced diseases disrupted traditional lifestyles and practices.  Many
soldiers, officers and emancipated convicts had turned land they received from
the government into flourishing farms. News of Brookland’s plentiful work was
bringing more and more boatloads of adventurous migrants. Settlers or
‘squatters’ began to move deeper into the territories – often with a gun - in
search of pasture and water for their stock. Springland was settled in the year
2503, by a squatter who sailed to Port Danford. At the same time a private
company, proud to have no convict links, settled Fairwalk in the south.
